  AXP2101 Poweron GPIO Access

  The AXP2101 has a poweron input that can be used essentially
  as one additional GPIO input. This binding allows declaration
  of a GPIO 'port' device that can be used to access this input.

compatible: "x-powers,axp2101-gpio"

include: [gpio-controller.yaml, base.yaml]

      Because the state of the poweron pin can only be known on
      transitions, the initial state is unknown. This can result
      in the first button event being missed. This property allows
      the initial state to be set to a known value.
